# Safauna

Our project’s  main objective is: to provide a caring family to street animals, while indirectly helping those who are scared of them, those who may have recently lost their pet or just want a new member of their family; and minimising dog breeding by decreasing the demand for pets.

 Our main activity is the “Një shtëpi për kafshët anekënd”, this activity is going to be a website launch, where users are going to be able to look for lost or abandoned animals, or post the lost animals that they found or want to get found. Some users are also going to enjoy the rewards that they might get by actively looking for animals.
